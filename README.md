# R package for Generalized Dissimilarity Modeling (GDM)

Generalized Dissimilarity Modeling is a statistical technique for modeling biotic compositional dissimilarity between pairs of geographical locations. The gdm package provides basic functions to fit, plot, predict and summarize Generalized Dissimilarity Models. Future updates will incorporate mapping using rasters and support for phylogenetic and genomic data.
